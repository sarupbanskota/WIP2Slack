0⃣ Clone this repo and get in: `git clone https://github.com/sarupbanskota/WIP2Slack && cd WIP2Slack` 

1⃣ [Setup an incoming webhook](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook) and note your `Incoming webhook URL`. You can choose which channel to post to in this step. If you've got multiple project channels you want to post to, you could setup multiple incoming hooks.

2⃣ [Obtain your `WIP private API key` URL](https://wip.chat/api) from the API page.

3⃣ Determine your WIP User ID - first complete a todo, then [visit the GraphiQL instance](https://wip.chat/graphiql). Type in the following and you should see your name at the top:
```js
{
  todos {
    user {
      id
      username
    }
  }
}
```

4⃣Export all necessary environment variables

```sh
 > export WIP_USER_ID=1096
 > export WIP_PROJECT_NAME=rojak
 > export WIP_API_KEY=xxxxx
 > export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=xxxx
 ```
 
5⃣Run the main file:

```sh
> ruby main.rb

> #<Net::HTTPOK:0x00007ff91c119d20>
```

Now get back to work. 

### Footnotes

The code is hacky in true WIP spirit. This is a community service project - do whatever you like with it! Feel free to send in a PR, I'll merge it if it makes sense to. 

If this saved you a half hour, you could [thank me with coffee money](https://www.paypal.me/sarupbanskota) :-)
